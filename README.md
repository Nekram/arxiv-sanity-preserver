# arxiv sanity preserver
This is a fork from arxiv sanity preserver from karpathy. For the unaltered version see the original link here

https://github.com/karpathy/arxiv-sanity-preserver


This fork is because I wanted to host it on a docker image for azure app services. It has a couple of hacks that I'd like to fix eventually but now i'm just concerned with getting it pushed to azure.
